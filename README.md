Aziz Elhamraoui - First Portfolio

Welcome to my very first personal portfolio website.  
This project is not a final representation of my skills, but rather a *milestone* in my journey as a self-taught developer.

I built this site to test and apply what I've been learning in *HTML* and *CSS*, and to have something to look back on as I grow.

ðŸ§  About Me

I'm Aziz Elhamraoui, passionate about:
- *Full-Stack Web Development*
- *Reverse Engineering*
- *Embedded Systems*
- *Malware Development*
- *Cybersecurity (Red Team Focus)*

Currently learning through self-study with the goal of becoming a skilled red teamer.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This portfolio is:
- A learning exercise
- A time capsule of where I started
- A motivation to keep improving
